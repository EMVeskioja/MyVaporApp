# Joke-Driven iOS Development

Welcome to the quirky side of iOS dev! This app was crafted under the soft glow of a single, flickering light bulb, with nothing but my trusty Lenovo and a pot of lukewarm coffee. ðŸŒŸ

## What is This?
Imagine a Swift app so sophisticated it tells you jokes. That's not what this is. This is a joke-telling app clumsily thrown together with Vapor, Swift, and a sprinkle of Heroku magicâ€”no databases, just good old-fashioned programmer humor, stored directly in the code because who has time for databases?

### "Features"
- Generates random programmer jokes, because who needs APIs when you have arrays?
- Built with Vapor, which is cool because it sounds like vaping but it's not.
- Deployed on Heroku because... why not?
- Itâ€™s so simple, a cat walking across the keyboard could probably deploy it (not tested).

## Why on Earth?
Why create this? Well, at 3 AM, things got weird and this seemed like a good idea. If you've ever coded while sleep-deprived, you might just understand.

## Quick Demo
No need to clone or run anything. Check out the live app:
